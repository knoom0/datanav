# Cursor Rules Location

## Description

All Cursor rules must be stored in the `.cursor/rules/` directory as `.mdc` (Markdown) files. Do not create rules in other locations such as `.cursorrules` or any other file.

## Pattern

✅ Do:
```
.cursor/
  rules/
    - my-rule.mdc
    - another-rule.mdc
```

❌ Don't:
```
.cursorrules
.cursor-rules
cursor-rules.md
rules/my-rule.md
```

## File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names: `my-coding-rule.mdc`
- Use `.mdc` extension (Markdown Cursor)
- Be descriptive but concise

## Rationale

- **Consistency**: All rules in one standardized location
- **Organization**: Easy to find and manage rules
- **Tool support**: Cursor IDE expects rules in `.cursor/rules/`
- **Version control**: Rules are tracked with the codebase

## File Pattern

All cursor rule files must be in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`

# Addressing Copilot PR Review Comments

## Description

When addressing Copilot review comments on pull requests, follow these guidelines to ensure changes are incremental, well-documented, and properly resolved.

## Process

1. **Read all Copilot reviews** on the PR and collect all comments
2. **Assess each comment** and determine if it requires:
   - A simple fix (can be done immediately)
   - A large refactor (add TODO comment instead)
3. **Make changes incrementally**:
   - Do NOT make large changes to address a comment
   - If a large change is required, add a TODO comment to address it later
   - Keep fixes small and focused
4. **Update the branch** only after addressing ALL comments
5. **Resolve the comments** after updating the branch by replying to each comment
6. **Do NOT wait** for CI checks to finish after updating the branch

## Example TODO Comments

For large changes that should be deferred:

```typescript
// TODO: Consider using IAM roles or AWS STS for temporary credentials instead of 
// storing AWS credentials directly in environment variables for better security

// TODO: Refactor this component to use React hooks instead of class components
// This requires significant changes to state management and lifecycle methods
```

## Rationale

- **Small, focused changes**: Easier to review and less likely to introduce bugs
- **TODOs for large work**: Keeps the PR moving forward without blocking on major refactors
- **Batch updates**: More efficient than updating after each comment
- **Timely resolution**: Shows responsiveness to feedback without waiting for CI
- **Clear communication**: Comments are acknowledged and addressed systematically
